# SmartClock on Raspberry Pi
## Make your own smartclock on cheap

I'm running a apache server on my Raspberry Pi and automatically launching this app on fullscreen after boot. There is plenty ways of making it better and more 'yours', but it's already preaty fun.

Some feauters are only on my second project called SmartClock-Manager which is a app to manage your SmartClock.

### Features
* Displaying current time and date
* Weather for 5 days
* Timer
* Stopwatch
* Alarm clock
* Themes

### TODO
* Change the alarm component to handle edit and deleting (for this moment you can do it only using SmartClock-Manager)
* Add displaying upcoming events from google calendar
* Add more themes
